== README

Blogger is a simple Rails app (5.0). The Ruby version is 2.4.2. DB is MySQL2.

I use this to test various services and instrumentations, so it can be a little wonky
depending on the state.

If you find you would like to use this for some of your own experiments, go for it.
It currently lacks tests, but hopefully will have them soon.

* Clone it

* bundle install

* rake db:setup

* Let me know if it's broken.
